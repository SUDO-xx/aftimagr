* Update README

* Document requirements for attachment_fu model. Needed if you use the 
  --skip-model option.
  
* --with-categories. Does this require a model? Can it be used alongside the
  --skip-model? Yes, just need to document if you use --skip-model that you
  will need to manually add the association in the model.
