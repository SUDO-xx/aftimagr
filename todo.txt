--- Demo Tasks

* --with-categories.
  - Generate a model and migration, setup association in attfu_model.rb. Might
    need to sleep when generating 2 migrations so the timestamps don't get
    duplicated.
  - For UI, use same as staging.caltech.edu.
  - Can it be used alongside the --skip-model? Yes, just need to document if
    you use --skip-model that you will need to manually add the association in
    the model.

* Minimal styling.

--- After Demo Tasks

* Fix naming with CamelCased arg.

* Scrollbars in TinyMCE popup.

* Re-evaluate options. Make sure they make sense; think about combinations.

* Change storage for --with-categories to store in a folder with category name.

* Document requirements for attachment_fu model. Needed if you use the 
  --skip-model option.
  
* Also generate tests for generated controller, models.
    
* Review and improve error messages.
    
* Verify, sanitize urls entered for images.

* Code audit. I've done this piecemeal over such a long time that I need to do
  a thorough audit for code quality and cohesiveness.

* Update README

===============================================================================
Development aides

* Javascript logging from within TinyMCE. Ability to toggle.

===============================================================================
Maybe Later

* Add option for singular name creation. In other words instead of the default
  article_image => ArticleImagesController, pass this option to get
  article_image => ArticleImageController.
