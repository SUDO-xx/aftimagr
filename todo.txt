--- After Demo Tasks

* Better way to override next_migration_string. Should only override that
  method when generating the migration for categories.

* Fix naming with CamelCased arg.

* Scrollbars in TinyMCE popup.

* Make some content tests, e.g., belongs_to and has_many get created for
  --with-categories.

* Split tests up into: generator, categories generator, content tests.
  assert_generated_model_for and similar tests take a block which gets yielded
  the contents of the file.

* Re-evaluate options. Make sure they make sense; think about combinations.

* Change storage for --with-categories to store in a folder with category name.

* Document requirements for attachment_fu model. Needed if you use the 
  --skip-model option.
  
* Also generate tests for generated controller, models, i.e., regular Rails 
  tests. See tests that ship with Rails.
    
* Review and improve error messages.
    
* Verify, sanitize urls entered for images.

* Code audit. I've done this piecemeal over such a long time that I need to do
  a thorough audit for code quality and cohesiveness.

* Update README

===============================================================================
Development aides

* Javascript logging from within TinyMCE. Ability to toggle.

===============================================================================
Maybe Later

* Add option for singular name creation. In other words instead of the default
  article_image => ArticleImagesController, pass this option to get
  article_image => ArticleImageController.
